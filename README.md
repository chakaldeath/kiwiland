Railroad company.

The ONEBOX's document 'Trains exercise' mentions three tasks: 
 1. Compute the distance along a certain route
 2. The number of different routes between two towns
 3. The shortest route between two towns

Some test had been created for each task. The name of the test class is RailroadManagerTest

For example for the first task (ONEBOX propose some inputs and outputs) the main test to execute are:
getDistanceRoute_example1_return9, getDistanceRoute_example2_return5, getDistanceRoute_example3_return13, getDistanceRoute_example4_return22,getDistanceRoute_example5_noSuchRoute

For the second task the main test are:
getTotalRoutesFromTwoTowns_fromAtoB_return4, getTotalRoutesFromTwoTowns_fromBtoA_return0, getTotalRoutesFromTwoTowns_random_returnValue

Finally, for the third task, the main test are:
getMinDistanceFromTwoTowns_fromAtoB_returnAB, getMinDistanceFromTwoTowns_fromBtoA_noSuchRoute, getMinDistanceFromTwoTowns_fromAtoC_returnABC
